# Library Template

This template provides a starting point for any library. In one click you will setup a tests folder, CMake, and more!

## Setup

Go to "setup.py", fill in your info there, and then run the script. It will setup everything with your library name and other information provided, remove all the setup scripts, and amend the initial commit. 

You can then force push the changes and start working on your library! ðŸŽ‰
