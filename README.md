# Library Template

This template provides a starting point for any library. In one click you will setup a tests folder, CMake, and more!

## Setup

Go to "setup.py", fill in your info there, and then run the script. It will setup everything with your library name and other information provided, and remove all the setup scripts.

You can then commit the changes and start working on your library! ðŸŽ‰
